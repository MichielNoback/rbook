4;Anser;albifrons;Greater White-fronted Goose;N;2-Sep-14;;1;Lucchesi Park;Sonoma;Scott Sorby;;This is the only bird that matches up with what I saw. Canada like goose, snow white bum prominent, coloring slightly lighter on the upper breast than Canada's. Head whitish with dark brown neck and crown. Looks to have a crescent molting in at beak. Dark eyes with white plumage carried above eyes and over the top of the forehead. Darkish spot in the white just above the bill- centered over the beak. Eyes look a little like they have goggles on. Grey beak with darker ridge down the top. Pale legs on the yellowish side. Light white speckles on the head where the dark brown is- only on the crown area. Low nasally honk on the quiet side. Looks to be in molt or more likely an immature.

I didn't have time to really examine it, but it was much smaller than the Canada Geese, it lacked a neck ring, it's bill was much smaller than the geese it was with.  This is the first time I have seen a Cackling Goose anywhere in California during the mid summer.

Looked to be one juv. with the smudgy darker tone than the white adults. Paid close attention to them with 20x and 40x scope viewing. Heads were distinctly shaped different than Mutes and had a light area on bill near the eye. Very light ski slope  upper edge. Mutes orange bills clear in the scope and the juv Mutes dark outline to bill distinctive.

There were willets in the area, and these were about the same size as a willet - much larger than a Virginia Rail.  I have seen a Clapper Rail before, some years ago, along this region of the Bay, but somewhat south of this observation point, so I know they can be found in this habitat.

The bird was below a wall and just west of a cutoff wall with a tall section (sort of like a short chimney) about a 1/4 of the way west of the east end of the island that I believe is the area it has been seen in  the past. It was partially obscured most of the time by vegetation at the west end of an open rocky area with nesting cormorants, but picked out by its large size and white body.  Initially faced west, and twice lumbered slightly east into the open.  Nonetheless, a very poor look at an all white bird with black wing tips, and what appeared at distance as a stout bill and a pale brownish rear crown and nape on an otherwise white head.

139;Egretta;caerulea;Little Blue Heron;N;20-Jul-14;;1;Salt Pond A16;Santa Clara;Kevin Kirby;;Bird was spotted standing in shallow water at the edge of a small island at the northern tip of Salt Pond A16 at roughly 2:50-3:00 p.m.  It had an obviously heron-like body morphology and stood approximately 24-30 high (to top of head).  We viewed it with no binoculars and the sun primarily striking its opposite side, under these conditions, it appeared to be a fairly solid dark grey in color.  It stood more or less unmoving for 4-6 minutes, then disappeared as we were looking elsewhere.  Later, at approximately 4:00 p.m., we spotted a bird in flight on the south edge of Salt Pond A16.  This may or may not have been the same individual, but it was effectively identical in size, shape, and coloring.  It was flying westward along the edge of the bermed road that forms the southern border of the pond, travelling at moderate speed at a constant altitude of maybe six feet above the water.  Again, it appeared to be unquestionably heron-shaped with a heron-like flight style.  Again, we viewed the bird with the sun stiking primarily its opposite side, and the best color description I could give for this sighting would be dark.  The bird was too small to be an adult Great Blue Heron, and it lacked the distinct white face and black eye band that I associate with that species, so my best guess (after consulting a number of online resources) is that this was a Lesser Blue Heron.

I watched it as it flew into the nest tree with a good sized rodent in its beak which it dropped off for the young COBH x RSHA chick which is now flying around the nest tree. The bird was entirely black with a very large yellow beak base. As the adult flew off from the nest I noted the white base of the outer primaries and the white tail bands.

I pulled over and we grabbed the binos to find that the third bird was a Ferruginous Hawk. It was being harassed,the Coop and I think the dove was caught in the melee and was just trying to get out of the way. The dove finally made its escape and the Coop peeled off also. We followed the FE south on Youngsdale until it continued past the end of the road and into the fields between Vacaville and Travis AFB. White underwings with very light patterning. Large yellow gape. Made a close pass overhead. Definite ID.

(w. Aleutians), and one from St. Paul Is. in the Pribilofs. But if you are talking about North American records, then you also need to add in the bird found near Ensenada, Mexico, a few years back (also in fall).

241;Calidris;pusilla;Semipalmated Sandpiper;N;9-Aug-14;;1;PRNS--Mendoza Ranch (B Ranch);Marin;logan kahle;;Seen in flight for several seconds immediately adjacent several Western Sandpipers. Noticably shorter-billed than all other nearby Westerns, which included relatively long-billed birds and relatively short-billed birds (which I took to be females and males, respectively). This bird seemed to show a more distinct auricular patch, too, contrasting strongly with the rest of the face, whereas other Westerns in the flock seemed to have a more diffuse facial pattern.

First discovered by Steve Howell the previous day, we joined Steve and Keith Hanson to search for it today.  Seen at a great distance in the company of three Ancient Murrelets, the black crest on the crown was flanked by prominent white head stripes extended to a point behind the head forming a pattern like that seen on a Great Kiskadee flycatcher.  The overall size seemed close to that of the nearby Ancient Murrelets, only marginally smaller.  The bird was observed off and on for a period of 40 minutes.  Howell obtained the best photo documentation.  Observed at a distance of 500 meters or so, a Swarovski scope at 60X was utilized.http://blog.aba.org/2014/11/open-mic-apparent-japanese-murrelet-in-california.html

A completely unexpectedly I noticed a owl sitting on a branch. In a very short time of this encounter, I noticed much slimmer body and buff-brown plumage in comparison with a Great Horned Owl, also, darker plumage with different face pattern (white x pattern in middle of face), and characteristic ear-tufts vertically erected in comparison with a Barn Owl. The Owl silently flew deeper into the bushes, just a fraction of a second before I was ready with camera.

Medium close eye-birds that could be seen well with bins. Large swifts, all-black, they were in North quadrant or directly above where any white patches or light shading would have been clearly visible.

422;Tyrannus;melancholicus;Tropical Kingbird;N;1-Oct-14;;1;SF Bay Trail;San Mateo;Adam Dudley;;The bird was actively feeding in trees along the creek between the Genentech campus and the Blue Line Transfer factory. Basically it's a large kingbird with an extensive yellow breast, belly and undertail. Light gray head with hint of a black eye mask on its ear coverts, greenish/gray back, dark brown tail with no white outer tail feathers, white throat and heavy, long black bill. I heard its distinctive call, a strident twittering, twice. It was quite mobile, flying regularly between the trees along the footpath and occasionally out into the bushes at the creek mouth. The lack of white in its tail was very obvious during these flights. Otherwise it spent its time perching conspicuously on the uppermost tree branches, making short flights to catch insects and returning to the same branch. It allowed quite close approach, and seemed not to be bothered by pedestrians or cyclists who passed beneath it on the trail.

441;Vireo;gilvus;Warbling Vireo;N;5-Dec-14;;2;Golden Gate Park--San Francisco Botanical Garden;San Francisco;Russ Bright;;Discovered with Peter O'Hara who photographed one or both of these birds. First heard calling, together in a thickly leafed small shrub in the children's garden near John Muir pond. One soon flew into view about 25' away and while looking at that we listened to a remaining bird singing, unseen &lt, 5' away! That bird soon flew into view. General description of both birds: Vireos with greenish wash to backs and dark grey crowns. Grey face with semi-circular white eyebrow arcing to pale lores and area around bill. Grey underside from throat to undertail coverts with extensive yellow wash on side and flanks to vent. One bird brighter overall, almost white on the underside and showing a sharper contrast between greenish back and darker crown. Neither had a dark eyeline. Seen just above eye level in overcast light. Active and intermittently visible for a couple of minutes.

Fairly dark crown, light supercilium, some yellow below, especially throat and untacs. Appeared smaller,mass than Warbling Vireo that landed in same tree, but perhaps largely an illusion of proportion.  Photos on file. Seen +/- 9:00 AM Gene Hunn saw one at Owl Canyon same date, 12:30 PM

A mid sized yellow bird came in which I looked at in the bins and could see was a larger vireo like a Red-eyed. I separated it from Red-eyed,the fact that it was extensively yellow on the belly and flanks to the breast sides. Also it had a gray crown with only a slightly darker edge to the crown, not a distinct black edge. Bill did not look that huge, but was sizeable. In other words, I am not sure it was any larger than a Red-eyed Vireo. This individual had brown eyes. Dark eyeline, greenish above, paler below, no wing bars. Seen for a short time before I rant out to get camera from car and came back to find it gone.

Detected quite a few as I walked down the trail.  Reporting '5' is a very conservative number.  I was able to get one in my binoculars to confirm.  It was in a conifer tree, it was very tiny, with a very tiny bill, underparts very light in color, striped face. Ruled out ruby-crowned kinglet because of the song and call notes which were much higher pitched.  What I kept hearing was several very high-pitched tweets, followed by a few faster lower tweets for a shorter period of time.  Learned its song, from Jim Steele, as Sisyphus - ceaselessly rolling a rock to the top of a mountain, then the stone falling back of its own weight.

Brown upperparts, strong, pale supercilium appeared to taper behind the eye, pale underparts streaked with off-white background color. Size and structure warbler-type, distance of about 80 feet precluded good views of bill, legs, or feet.
541;Parkesia;noveboracensis;Northern Waterthrush;N;28-Aug-14;31-Aug-14;1;Tilden Nature Area--Jewel Lake;Contra Costa;Steve Rose, Diane Rose;mob;It was first spotted perched low in a small tree above the outflow channel of Jewell Lake.  It was near the control platform about half way down the channel.  I could see what appeared to be a warbler with a strong supercilium, fairly white below with prominent dark streaks and dark grayish back and wings.  I was fairly sure that it was a Northern Waterthrush, but the bird was perched on a small limb a few feet from the ground, in heavy shade and was not bobbing its tail.  Within a few seconds, it flew directly down and onto the muddy channel floor and began to feed characteristically by walking and bobbing as it picked food from the mud.  I knew I had to eliminate the Louisanna Waterthrush from consideration and the bird was in better light in the channel.  The supercilium appeared whitish with a bit of buff tinge, especially the first third, plus it did not seem to flare slightly behind the eye.  The legs appeared dull pink.  The bill did not seem noteably heavy or long but that is always difficult to judge in a solitary bird.  The underparts were dark-streaked with a whitish ground color that looked slightly tinged yellow or buff.  Looking at a somewhat downward angle to the bird, it was difficult to see the throat, but after some minutes, it was nice enough to fly back up and perch above the top of the channel wall.  This time I was able to see that the throat indeed was finely streaked blackish.  It then flew farther downstream and out of view, but proceeded to give very loud tack calls.  I briefly played a few Northern Waterthrush calls, and the bird quickly returned to the channel and resumed feeding.

The undertail coverts appeared to reach most of the way towards the tip of the tail.  The outer tail feathers had large white spots.  The mantle was green, making a contrasting green triangle surrounded by a a blue-gray head, wings, and tail.  I did not notice leg color.

Stood on lawn as we viewed it. Yellow underside, including chin, with faint streaks on flanks. Grayish crown with light area around eye, but not a distinct eye-ring. Mantle dull olive. The bird appeared within the same cypress several times over the course of the 15 minutes I watched. I then scouted the broader area around the residence and on return heard a half an hour later heard that the bird had not been seen again. At least four observers saw this bird and each reviewed Sibley's to confirm ID.

There was a distinct whitish central crown stripe.  The lores appeared to be unmarked.  The back, not seen as well, was light brown with thick dark brown streaks.  The bird was too bright and crisply marked for a Brewer's Sparrow and I think the facial pattern and other features argue against Chipping Sparrow.  My best photo of the bird is pasted below:

Reyes--Abbotts Lagoon;Marin;Ken Schneider, Wendy Dreskin;mob;colorful sparrow along the southwestern shore of outer Abbott's Lagoon around 1130.  I initially misidentified the bird in the field as a Nelson's Sparrow, but photos later revealed it to be this species.  I unfortunately took minimal field notes, believing the bird to be a Nelson's, so my description is based predominantly on my digiscoped photos, which show a beautifully patterned sparrow with a broad orange supercilium and malar stripe, gray auriculars, and a dark posterior eye line which broadens substantially toward the rear.  There is a pale central crown stripe and dark lateral crown stripes.  The throat was pale buffy, paler than the malar stripes.  The central breast was similar in color to the throat and largely unstreaked, but the flanks showed crisp dark streaking.  The nape was grayish with fine reddish-purple streaks and the upperparts were dark with some pale striping.  The dark tertials appear to completely cover the folded primaries, with little to no primary projection.  The small, conical bill was pink, as were the legs.  I did not hear the bird vocalize.

Raju's pictures are at: https://www.flickr.com/photos/thecaravan/ . The bird was calling loudly and the call sounded like the squeaky-shoes-on-gym-floor eek call of a Rose-breasted Grosbeak, rather than the lower-pitched pit of a Black-headed Grosbeak. The pale bill, brown upperparts, and extent of streaking on the underparts, along with the call, point to a (female) Rose-breasted Grosbeak.

It had a long (but still shorter than the length of the head), stout bill with a pointed tip. Its iris was pale. The tail was medium length with the central tail feathers being noticeably longer. The head was glossy black with a bluish sheen. This contrasted with the body and wings which were blackish, but with a brown tinge. As well as the harsh calls, the bird also gave a longer call a couple times. In flight the tail was flared and diamond shaped to rounded.

Male reddish beneath, female yellow beneath, issuing diagnostic staccato calls but I am not yet skilled in separating RECR call types.

Distinctive clear and downslurred, melancholy kype-kype flight call of this type. From other plausible call types, not the snappy as type 1 or the VGSW-like kip-kip of type 3, not as rough and HOFI-like as type 5, not as wet as type 4 or dry as type 10. Experience with distinguishing this call type from others in SCZ, E. Sierra, and Great Basin.

Initially thought to be several birds due to volume of calls but once visual was obtained it seemed clear that it was just one highly vocal birds. Flight calls crossbill-style sharp notes delivered in rapid but erratic succession, interspersed with high, reedy calls simlar to those of waxwings. Stocky silhouette of a finch-type bird, slightly larger than those of Carpodacus finches, seen against a bright early-AM sky. No plumage details observable. Tail short and blocky.

It was either an adult female or an immature. The calls were very distinctive and definitive. Very soon it flew off accompanied by two or more others giving the same call, which I did not manage to see. Fortunately I had prepared myself in preceding days by reviewing calls on xeno-canto.org, in response to a couple of recent fly-overs by birds giving the same call.
